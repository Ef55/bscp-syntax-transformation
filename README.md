# Making syntaxes LL1 through transformations

This repository contains my (Noé De Santo) Bachelor project.

The exact content is the following:

- The [report](report/report.pdf);
- The [implementation](code/src/main/scala/scallion/) of the transformations, 
their [tests](code/src/test/scala/scallion/)
and an [example](code/example/tags);
- The [documentation](https://ef55.github.io/bscp-syntax-transformation/) of the code.

If you want to actually run the code, it might be easier to clone my [fork](https://github.com/Ef55/scallion/tree/factorization) of the scallion repository (**branch «factorization»**), which also contains ScaLL1on's code and already has SBT set up.
